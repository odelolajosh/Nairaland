# NairaLand + GenZTechies

Let's get started ðŸš€ðŸš€

## About
We aim to build the new [NairaLand Design](https://www.figma.com/file/HwRRwdEXA5Nx6GhbUHM04F/Nairaland-Web-Design?node-id=19%3A3791) using plain HTML/CSS. The reason for this is to allow more people to contribute. Yes, the code will later be implemented using a framework when approved.

## Contributing Code
There are three folders:
- `assets/`
- `components/`
- `pages/`

### Components
- The project will start off by building out each component specified in the design file. 
- Each component will have its own folder in the components directory.
- The folder should contain all the elements required to build the component and be implemented in an index.html file.
- All images, CSS, or JavaScript files should be in their corresponding folder.
- Do not create any new JS or CSS file. Use the one already in place.
- Do not alter code where you are not supposed to.
- When the component is complete, implement it in "components/index.html" using the demo guide.

### Assets
- Place images in the "images/" folder.
- Place icons in the "icons/" folder.
- CSS and JavaScript go into the main.css or main.js

### Pages
